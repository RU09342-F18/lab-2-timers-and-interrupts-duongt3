# Button Based Delay
This lab allows the user to control the rate at which the LED blinks. The LED will blink at a rate at which the user holds down the button. This lab uses Timer modules built in the microcontroller to keep track of how long the user held down the button. Once the user releases the button, the timer will now count up to the time the button was held down. There is no minimum period and the maximum period the user can designate is 16 seconds.
